<!-- ### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```

<!-- ### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## Development

I forced myself to use the defaults that came with [Mantine's Vite template](https://github.com/mantinedev/vite-template), which means using Yarn as package manager. Turns out it's pretty good, particularly the `yarn.lock` file which looks a lot cleaner/readable than npm's `package-lock.json`.

See [Corepack](https://yarnpkg.com/corepack) if you need help setting up Yarn on your machine.

To get started, run `yarn` (or `yarn install`) in the terminal.

To install dependencies, use `yarn add <packagename>`; for dev dependencies, include the `-D`/`--dev` flag, e.g., `yarn add -D <packagename>`.

To run the scripts below, use `yarn run <scriptname>`.

### Build and dev scripts

- `dev` â€“ start development server
- `build` â€“ build production version of the app
- `preview` â€“ locally preview production build

### Testing scripts

- `typecheck` â€“ checks TypeScript types
- `lint` â€“ runs ESLint
- `prettier:check` â€“ checks files with Prettier
- `vitest` â€“ runs vitest tests
- `vitest:watch` â€“ starts vitest watch
- `test` â€“ runs `vitest`, `prettier:check`, `lint` and `typecheck` scripts

### Other scripts

- `storybook` â€“ starts storybook dev server
- `storybook:build` â€“ build production storybook bundle to `storybook-static`
- `prettier:write` â€“ formats all files with Prettier

## Deployment

This app is deployed on Cloudflare Pages, with automatic deployments enabled for the `develop` and `staging` branches (preview deploys) and `master` branch (production deploy).

Preview deployments can be accessed at https://develop.browser-extensions-manager.pages.dev and https://staging.browser-extensions-manager.pages.dev
